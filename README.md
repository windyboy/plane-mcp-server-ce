A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Plane integration. This server provides tools and resources for interacting with Plane through AI agents.

## Features

* 🔧 **Plane Integration**: Interact with Plane APIs and services
* 🔌 **Multiple Transports**: Supports stdio, SSE, and streamable HTTP transports
* 🌐 **Remote & Local**: Works both locally and as a remote service
* 🛠️ **Extensible**: Easy to add new tools and resources

## Usage

The server supports three transport methods. **We recommend using `uvx`** as it doesn't require installation.

**Requirements**:
- **Python 3.10+** (for stdio transport, via `uvx`)
- **Node.js 22+** (for remote transports, via `npx`)

### 1. Stdio Transport (for local use)

**MCP Client Configuration** (using uvx - recommended):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plane": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["plane-mcp-server", "stdio"],
      "env": {
        "PLANE_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>",
        "PLANE_WORKSPACE_SLUG": "<your-workspace-slug>",
        "PLANE_BASE_URL": "https://<your-self-hosted-plane-url>",
        "PLANE_MCP_EDITION": "community"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Remote HTTP Transport with OAuth

Connect to the hosted Plane MCP server using OAuth authentication.

**URL**: `https://mcp.plane.so/http/mcp`

**MCP Client Configuration** (for tools like Claude Desktop without native remote MCP support):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plane": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote@latest", "https://mcp.plane.so/http/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: OAuth authentication will be handled automatically when connecting to the remote server.

### 3. Remote HTTP Transport using PAT Token

Connect to the hosted Plane MCP server using a Personal Access Token (PAT).

**URL**: `https://mcp.plane.so/http/api-key/mcp`

**Headers**:
- `Authorization: Bearer <PAT_TOKEN>`
- `X-Workspace-slug: <SLUG>`

**MCP Client Configuration** (for tools like Claude Desktop without native remote MCP support):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plane": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote@latest", "https://mcp.plane.so/http/api-key/mcp"],
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <PAT_TOKEN>",
        "X-Workspace-slug": "<SLUG>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. SSE Transport (Legacy)

⚠️ **Legacy Transport**: SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport is maintained for backward compatibility. New implementations should use the HTTP transport (sections 2 or 3) instead.

Connect to the hosted Plane MCP server using OAuth authentication via Server-Sent Events.

**URL**: `https://mcp.plane.so/sse`

**MCP Client Configuration** (for tools that support SSE transport):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plane": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote@latest", "https://mcp.plane.so/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: OAuth authentication will be handled automatically when connecting to the remote server. This transport is deprecated in favor of the HTTP transport.


## Configuration

### Authentication

The server requires authentication via environment variables:

- `PLANE_BASE_URL`: Base URL for Plane API (default: `https://api.plane.so`) - Optional
- `PLANE_API_KEY`: API key for authentication (required for stdio transport)
- `PLANE_WORKSPACE_SLUG`: Workspace slug identifier (required for stdio transport)
- `PLANE_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Access token for authentication (alternative to API key)
- `PLANE_MCP_EDITION`: Tool discovery mode: `community` (or `ce`) exposes only
  tools verified against Plane CE; `cloud` (or `all`) exposes the complete SDK
  surface; `auto` is the default and treats a configured non-`*.plane.so` API
  URL as self-hosted. Set `community` explicitly for predictable self-hosted
  deployments, especially if you use a custom Cloud domain.

**Example** (for stdio transport):
```bash
export PLANE_BASE_URL="https://api.plane.so"
export PLANE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export PLANE_WORKSPACE_SLUG="your-workspace-slug"
export PLANE_MCP_EDITION="community"
```

**Note**: For remote HTTP transports (OAuth or PAT), authentication is handled via the connection method (OAuth flow or PAT headers) and does not require these environment variables.

### OAuth redirect URIs

For the OAuth HTTP/SSE transports, the server validates each client's redirect URI against an allowlist. Common MCP clients (Cursor, VS Code, Claude.ai, ChatGPT connectors, localhost) are allowed by default.

To onboard a new client without a code change or release, append extra patterns via an environment variable:

- `PLANE_OAUTH_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URIS`: Comma-separated redirect URI patterns appended to the built-in allowlist.

```bash
export PLANE_OAUTH_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URIS="https://newclient.com/cb,https://other.app/oauth/*"
```

Patterns support glob matching (`*` matches any port, path segment, or subdomain). For security, keep the host pinned and wildcard only the port/path.

### Logging

The server emits structured JSON logs. Each tool call is logged with its tool name, duration, status, and (when available) the opaque user id and workspace slug.

- `LOG_USER_INFO`: When `true`, include user info (PII such as the display name) in logs alongside the opaque user id. Defaults to `false` so PII is never logged unless explicitly opted in. Only the OAuth and PAT (header) HTTP transports carry a display name; stdio is unaffected.

```bash
export LOG_USER_INFO="true"
```

## Available Tools

The server provides comprehensive tools for interacting with Plane. All tools use Pydantic models from the Plane SDK for type safety and validation.

### Community Edition availability

Set `PLANE_MCP_EDITION=community` to prevent unavailable tools from being
advertised to an agent. This keeps the MCP tool list focused on functionality
that exists on the free, self-hosted edition instead of returning cryptic 404
errors. The detailed endpoint evidence is maintained in [CE_COMPAT.md](CE_COMPAT.md).

| Capability group | Available in CE mode | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Projects, members, cycles, modules, labels, states, intake items | Yes | CE-compatible endpoints, including the CE fallback for `*-lite` lists. |
| Work items, search, activities, comments, links, attachments | Yes | Detail reads automatically expand assignees and labels. |
| Work item relations | Partial | Listing and creating the eight built-in relation types work; CE stable exposes no deletion route. |
| Work item property definitions and options | Partial | Definition tools remain exposed; per-item property values are not available. |
| Feature flags, roles, initiatives, milestones | No | Cloud-only / paid API surface. |
| Work logs, archived work items, estimates | No | Endpoints are absent from the tested CE API. |
| Pages, work item types, custom relation definitions | No | Pages exist in the CE UI, but only through legacy session-authenticated `/api/...` routes; PAT-based MCP access is unavailable. The other endpoints are absent. |

The category tables below describe the full SDK surface. Rows marked **No** or
**Partial** above are deliberately omitted from MCP discovery in Community
Edition mode.

## Deprecation Notice

⚠️ **The Node.js-based `plane-mcp-server` is deprecated and no longer maintained.**

This repository represents the new Python+FastMCP based implementation of the Plane MCP server. If you were using the previous Node.js version, please migrate to this Python-based version for continued support and updates.

The new implementation offers:
- Better type safety with Pydantic models
- Improved performance with FastMCP
- Enhanced tool coverage
- Active maintenance and development

For migration assistance, please refer to the configuration examples in this README or open an issue for support.

**Old Node.js Configuration (Deprecated):**

If you were using the previous Node.js-based `@makeplane/plane-mcp-server`, your configuration looked like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plane": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@makeplane/plane-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PLANE_API_KEY": "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
        "PLANE_API_HOST_URL": "<HOST_URL_FOR_SELF_HOSTED>",
        "PLANE_WORKSPACE_SLUG": "<YOUR_WORKSPACE_SLUG>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Please migrate to the new Python-based configuration shown in the Usage section above.**
